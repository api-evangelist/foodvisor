  Foodvisor is a mobile application that helps users track their nutrition and
  achieve their health goals. By simply taking a picture of their meals,
  Foodvisor uses artificial intelligence to identify the food items and provide
  the user with valuable information such as calorie counts, macronutrient
  breakdown, and overall nutritional value. Users can set personal goals,
  receive personalized recommendations, and track their progress over time. With
  Foodvisor, users can make more informed food choices, improve their eating
  habits, and ultimately lead a healthier lifestyle.
